The intention of this project is to create a functional proof-of-concept for energy efficient presence detection, with the Chipcon/Texas Instruments CC2431 as the implementation platform and using the SimpliciTI framework. Made as part of the Wireless Networks course at the University of Southampton.

A presentation of the project is available at http://prezi.com/3mu5ezuedgum/wireless-squirrels/?kw=view-3mu5ezuedgum&rc=ref-25005357

The assignment description is as follows: Energy-efficient presence detection. (How many squirrels are the in the wood?) Design and implement an identifier algorithm to identify sensors in a network using visible sensors to relay information. Battery life and response time are key performance indicators. Simulation of N sensors, practical implementation of 3-4 on IEEE802.15.4 devices. Compare with what may be possible with Bluetooth LE (Smart Energy).
