Energy-efficient presence detection. (How many squirrels 
are the in the wood?)
Design and implement an identifier algorithm to identify sensors 
in a network using visible sensors to relay information. Battery 
life and response time are key performance indicators. 
Simulation of N sensors, practical implementation of 3-4 on 
IEEE802.15.4 devices. Compare with what may be possible 
with Bluetooth LE (Smart Energy).
